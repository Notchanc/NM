1) Bisection Method

Always works if the function changes sign in the interval.

Simple and easy to understand.

Guarantees convergence (it will always find a root eventually).


2) Regula Falsi Method (False Position Method)

Faster than the bisection method.

Always converges if the function changes sign.

More accurate than bisection in fewer steps.


3) Newton-Raphson Method

Very fast if the initial guess is good.

Works well for most functions.

Requires fewer iterations than bisection and regula falsi.


4) Gauss Elimination Method

Solves systems of linear equations efficiently.

Works for any number of equations and variables.

Can be used for both small and large systems.


5) L.U. Decomposition Method

Faster than Gauss Elimination for multiple solutions.

Saves time when solving equations with the same coefficient matrix.

Useful in numerical computations and programming.


6) Trapezoidal Method

Simple and easy to apply for integration.

Works well for smooth functions.

More accurate than the basic rectangle method.


7) Simpson’s ⅓ Rule

More accurate than the trapezoidal method.

Works well for both simple and complex functions.

Requires fewer calculations for the same accuracy.


8) Euler’s Method

Simple and easy for solving differential equations.

Good for an initial rough estimate.

Can be used as a base for improved methods.


9) Runge-Kutta Method

More accurate than Euler’s method.

Works well for many differential equations.

Provides a balance between accuracy and speed.
