1) Bisection Method vs. Regula Falsi Method

Bisection Method cuts the interval in half every time, making it slower but always reliable.

Regula Falsi Method uses a smarter guess based on the function values, making it faster but sometimes slower in special cases.


2) Bisection & Regula Falsi vs. Newton-Raphson Method

Bisection & Regula Falsi work without needing derivatives, but they can be slower.

Newton-Raphson needs a derivative but is much faster if the initial guess is good.


3) Gauss Elimination vs. L.U. Decomposition

Gauss Elimination solves a system of equations step by step but has to be repeated for different solutions.

L.U. Decomposition breaks the matrix into simpler parts, making repeated solutions faster.


4) Trapezoidal Method vs. Simpson’s ⅓ Rule

Trapezoidal Method connects points with straight lines, making it simpler but less accurate.

Simpson’s ⅓ Rule fits curves to the points, giving better accuracy with fewer calculations.


5) Euler’s Method vs. Runge-Kutta Method

Euler’s Method is the simplest way to approximate solutions but can be inaccurate.

Runge-Kutta improves accuracy by taking better steps without making things too complex.
